2022-11-07 4:30pm During the OHs, Adam helped me clarify the scale unit of chunk loading/expansion could be either a chunk or a zone for milestone 1, depending on how much(or how efficient) a test run you want it to look like.
2022-11-07 8:15pm I asked my classmate Yue Zhang what should I do when checking adjacant face of a block outside of the chunk, i.e. the x or z coord of the block is <0 or >15. She reminded me of a similar piazza question someone posted. The answer is that we should check the m_neighbors.
2022-11-07 9:00pm I asked my classmate Yue Zhang about the model matrix for the terrain.
2022-11-09 4:00pm During the OHs, TA Rhuta gave me advice on debugging chunkVBOs by checking a specific chunk, i.e. its location compared to player position and its color.
2022-11-09 5:00pm My teammate Tianyi helped me with debugging my block faces drawing apart (not forming a closed geometr). We realized that it was my vertex position set up incorrectly using the adjacent face's position while adding the face vertex's position. This equates to duplicate 1 unit position twice.
2022-11-09 8:00pm During the OHs, TA Lorant helped me with debugging my chunks only drawing a 8x8 unit area, not the 16x16 block area as expected. He finally found out that it was me adding two vec4s with both w=1, resulting in a w=2, when passing the vertex position into the buffer, that causes the vs_Pos in the vertex shader half of the original value. During the homogenized step in OpenGL, all the positions are divided by w (which was 2 in my case), so the result will be half size smaller.
2022-11-10 2:00pm During the OHs, I asked TA Lorant some simple ways to improve my chunking performance before multithreading in the next milestone. He recommended 1. using global positions for the vertex data directly without calling the setModelMatrix function for every chunk. 2.flag the chunks that already have VBO data created or buffered to avoid duplicate processing VBOs.
2022-11-16 8:30pm During the OHs, TA Joanna helped me understand how caves can be generated from sampling 3D Perlin noises.
2022-11-17 8:00pm During the OHs, TA Joanna helped me understand the post-processing pipeline.
2022-11-18 4:30pm During the OHs, TA Logan helped me debug with "OpenGL 1285" error after merging my partner's transparent texture code. We couldn't figure out why only my computer is having this problem, but we accidentally solved another issue in opaque block texturing itself, where the fragment shader was using fbm noise after sampling a normal texture.
2022-11-21 4:00pm During the OHs, TA Shubham helped us debug with texture rendering after merging my partner's multithreading code. We realized that it was the texture loading and binding part called over and over for each chunk in multi-threads that caused the problem. I moved the texture loading part out to mygl and only execute once.
2022-11-28 5:00pm I asked Adam how to solve chunk boundaries drawing duplicate faces. It was a leftover bug from milestone 1 chunking that we forgot to handle during milestone 2. The solution is simple. In multithreading, we need to update the neighboring chunks during terrain expansion.
2022-11-30 3:00pm During the OHs, TA Aditya helped me debug with my integration of skybox demo code not working. There was a GL_INVALID_OPERATION error (which should be "in"s and "uniform"s not associated properly with CPU handles). We checked every variable and figured out that it was the variable type of my u_Time is an int(which is wierd time is integer) but the input of my frag.glsl should be a float.
2022-11-30 8:00pm During the OHs, I asked TA Lorant to help me debug a long-standing issue from milestone 2, OpenGL 1285 when including the drawTransparent() texture feature. After going through every texture-related code, we figured it out that it was the draw function of transparent texture passing in the wrong element count to OpenGL. Instead of d.elemTransCount(), our texturing person forgot to update the variable after copying and pasting the function from the opaque texture draw(), leaving d.elemCount() intact.
		  The opaque texture element count if far more than the transparent element count, thus causing the Out of Memory issue on the GPU side. Although we solved the problem in the end, it still seems confusing that my two partners didn't have errors when rendering the transparent texture, as this should be a fairly prominent bug.
2022-12-01 5:00pm I looked up Shadertoy for some inspiration of star field. I used https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsjGDy as a reference for our skybox background at night.
2022-12-01 8:00pm When browsing day-night cycles and procedural sky shaders in Shadertoy, I came across this amazing piece https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3slXDB. I added the comet code to our skybox to create some mysterious vitality at night. I also referred to https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7tsfWM for the clouds simulation using perlin noise.
2022-12-05 3:00pm I looked up https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/osg-shader-fog/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27898985/range-based-fog-in-glsl for ideas of implementing distance fog. I decided to just use a linear distance function to create our distance fog becasue it's easy and the results already seem good enough.
2022-12-07 5:00pm During the OHs, Adam helped me debug with shadow mapping. He helped me understand the orthographic frustum used in this approach and tweaked around the light source camera matrix parameters to make the show appear in the scene at least.
2022-12-09 10:30am I had attempted to implement voxelization within a three-day period. During the OHs, I asked TA Helena whether there's any heads-up about using multithreading for voxelization. After going through the logic/ algorithm, we came to a conclusion that the voxelization algorithm might be the most costy part, rather than actually rendering the voxelized mesh object. It should be enough to run on the main thread, but not 100% sure. It'd be better to have some implementation ready before worrying about this.
2022-12-10 4:00pm I asked my friend Wenqing about ways to optimize shadow mapping, as mine looked quite jaggy/shaky on the edge. The shadky edge might be a result of the light source moving too fast. Wenqing suggest me either add soft shadows, aka, poisson sampling/ gaussian blur, to make the jaggy edge less prominent, or increase the resolution of my depth texture in the first render pass.
